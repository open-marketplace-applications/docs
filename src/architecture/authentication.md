[Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies.
